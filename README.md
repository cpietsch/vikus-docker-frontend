VIKUS Docker instance builder FRONTEND

This is a simple frontend for the vikus-docker. It is used to create a new VIKUS Viewer instance.
Right now the frontend is only used to create a new VIKUS Viewer instance from an IIIF collection V3.

## How to use the frontend
1. Input a IIIF collection V3 URL in the input field
2. Click the "Create" button
3. Now you can change the settings of the VIKUS Viewer instance or just use the default settings by clicking the "Generate Instance" button

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:
